<center>As the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development rolls out its plan to move from institutional care to family and community based care for 
<br>children it is imperative that all stakeholders including other government ministries, 
<br>the corporate sector and civil society be focused on the common objective and work together to lay a strong foundation.
<br>It is a big task. 
<br>We need to to collaborate to end the practice of children being raised in institutions; 
<br>to transition to a family and community based care system that will end the disturbing trend in babies being abandoned.</center>

<font face="arial" size="4" color="black"> 
OrphanCare is working with the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development and select registered private child care institutions on reintegrating children back into families.
<p>Findings from OrphanCare’s pilot reintegration project presented at our national conference in November 2016 highlighted several areas that need immediate attention.
<br>Inadequate housing, insufficient financial aid for single mothers, lack of facilities and services such as free day care and medical support especially for children with disabilities are challenging issues.

<center><b>Why we need to collaborate</b></center>
<p>
<font face="arial" size="4" color="black"> 
<center>Reintegration is a drawn out process that takes 6 months to 2 years and sometimes even longer. Reuniting an orphan from an institution with his or her family is fraught with problems. Poverty is a significant factor; families struggle with basic needs as they live hand to mouth. 
<p>
During the transition period children and their families need to quickly establish some level of socio-economic independence for the emotional security that makes re-bonding work. 
We recognise this.Our reintegration programmes target economics and psychology. If poverty caused the separation that situation must be remedied.</center>

<center><b>How to collaborate</b></center>
<p>
<font face="arial" size="4" color="black"> 
<center>We invite interested, willing and able parties to work with us to facilitate this crucial transition period. 
<br>Building capacity in family and community based services and developing programmes requires a multifaceted approach. 
<br>Building the infrastructure and network to sustain these children and their families requires input from a variety of sources.</center>
