<center><br>The transformation from institutions looking after children to a family and community based care system requires driven, 
<br>committed people – innovative thinkers, good planners, team players and effective doers – to steer the way forward.
<br>With urbanisation and the rise in numbers of nuclear families there will be adjustments in the way we look after our children.
<br>OrphanCare’s pioneering effort could set off a chain reaction in job opportunities within this new ‘paradigm’.
<br>Our mission is to help every child in Malaysia grow up in a loving family environment.
<br>If you feel as passionate about this as we do, consider a career with us. 
<br>Our growing team is energetic and enthusiastic about developing solutions to improve the lives of Malaysia’s less privileged children.
<br>Our work environment is demanding but if you have empathy OrphanCare Foundation is a good place to begin a fulfilling career.
